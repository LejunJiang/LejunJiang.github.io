        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the winter break between Dec. 2019 and Jan. 2020, I went on a great trip across the US: starting from Michigan, I went to Illinois, took a train (the California Zephyr) to California, then drove to Nevada, Utah, and in the end Arizona. This trip took us 18 days and we found great joy in it, especially in photography. <br /><br>We spent a total of 6 days in Arizona, including 1 day at Page, 3 days at the Grand Canyon, and 2 days at Phoenix. I have only posted the photos at the Grand Canyon for now. I will update the others in the future.</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Grand-Canyon-National-Park"><a href="#Grand-Canyon-National-Park" class="headerlink" title="Grand Canyon National Park"></a>Grand Canyon National Park</h1><p>The magnificence of the Grand Canyon is beyond description. It still stands true at night. I found this magical place with the desert tower, and took this photo on a very cold cold night. (There are many wild animals at the Grand Canyon, possibly including leopards. We were lucky that we did not encounter them, but be careful if you are out there, especially at night.)</p><p><img src="/images/Arizona/Grand_Canyon_1.jpg" alt=""></p>]]></content>

This trip took us 18 days and we found great joy in it, especially in photography. <br /><br>We spent a total of 2 days in Nevada, most of which were spent on gambling and watching shows… It was a fantastic experience but in return there were few photos to share with you. Therefore, I put photo taken at the Death Valley (at the borderline of California and Nevada) here.</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Death-Valley"><a href="#Death-Valley" class="headerlink" title="Death Valley"></a>Death Valley</h1><p>Death Valley is a desert valley we traveled through on our way to Las Vegas.

On our way there, the stars shined so brightly on the sky that we could not help but stopped our car and took these beautiful photos in the desert.</p><p><img src="/images/Nevada/Nevada_night_star1.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/images/Nevada/Nevada_night_star2.jpg" alt=""></p>]]></content>

This trip took us 18 days and we found great joy in it, especially in photography. <br /><br>We spent a total of 7 days in California. Here are the photos taken during this period.</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="San-Francisco"><a href="#San-Francisco" class="headerlink" title="San Francisco"></a>San Francisco</h1><p>San Francisco is no doubt a wonderful place to live in. We spent four days here during this trip. Fisherman’s Wharf is the area we resided during our stay, it is a beautiful place to wander around.</p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Fishermans_Wharf.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The streets in San Francisco are unique in the sense that they are so straight while there are so many slopes in the city at the same time.</p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Street.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a famous tourist destination in San Francisco. Due to time limitation, we could only visit it in the middle of the day. It was a liitle pity that I could not take photos at this place at different light conditions (I will probably try to visit this place at another time in the future).</p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Golden_Gate_Bridge.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The Twin Peaks is no doubt another famous scenic spot in San Francisco. We took a cab to the peaks at dusk and stayed until 10 pm, it is a wonder place for night view of San Fancisco.</p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Twin_Peaks1.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Twin_Peaks2.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/images/California/San_Francisco_Twin_Peaks3.jpg" alt=""></p><h1 id="California-State-Route-1"><a href="#California-State-Route-1" class="headerlink" title="California State Route 1"></a>California State Route 1</h1><p>California State Route 1 is a beautiful beautiful highway along the western coast. Stopping anywhere along it would result in fabulous photos.</p><p><img src="/images/California/Highway_No_1.jpg" alt=""></p><h1 id="Monterey"><a href="#Monterey" class="headerlink" title="Monterey"></a>Monterey</h1><p>Monterey is the most beautiful town by the sea I have ever seen. Everything there just seens so natural and peaceful. In my mind, any Californian trip without this place would be meaningless.</p><p><img src="/images/California/Monterey1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>It is also the place where the TV series “Big Little Lies” was shot. Following the locations in the TV series, we arrived at the Bixby Bridge at sunset. I took this dreamlike photo accompanied by a number of photographers who were also waiting for this fabulous scenery.</p><p><img src="/images/California/Monterey2.jpg" alt=""></p>]]></content>
